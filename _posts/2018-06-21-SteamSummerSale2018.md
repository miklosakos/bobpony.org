# Since steam summer sale is around the corner I've made a list of games you should buy if you don't have them right now.

- [Valve Complete Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/) (Over 20 Games)
Don't have enough? Then get the [Orange Box](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/) (Costs probably the same amount as your lunch!)
- [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/)
- [Rocket League](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/Rocket_League/)
- [DOOM 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/DOOM_3/)
- [DIRT 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/421020/DiRT_4/)

Have a lot of money to spend on? Then this pack might be a good deal for you!!!
